# Advent of Code 2024

- Run `task prep` to set up for today, it will create the folder, `main.go` file, and it will try to download the input.
- Manually copy the test data from the puzzle text to `test.txt`.
- Run `task test1` to run the code in the `part1()` function against the `test.txt` data.
- Run `task test2` to run the code in the `part2()` function against the `test.txt` data.
- For testing against other files, specify `TESTFILE` like so:
  - `task test1 TESTFILE=test2.txt`
- Run `task run1` and `task run2` to run parts 1 and 2 respectivily against the puzzle input.
